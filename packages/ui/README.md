# PLM UI Modules

This package is for UI components and helper functions that are shared across multiple
packages (i.e. the extension and the webapp).

This package is outside of "common" because the setup for this package is
different from that of the common package (i.e., requires transpilation from JSX/TSX to JS)

## How To Run

See main README. In general:

1. run `npm ci` in the root directory
2. run `npm run dev` in this directory to compile the UI Modules.
